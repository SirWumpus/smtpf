smtpf 1.0
=========

1. Installation
---------------

1.1 Unix Systems
----------------

	tar -zxf libsnert-1.63.tar.gz
	tar -zxf smtpf-1.0.tar.gz
	cd com/snert/src/lib
	./configure --without-db
	make clean build
	cd ../smtpf
	./configure
	make clean build
	sudo make install


1.2 Windows Systems
-------------------

Double-click on ``smtpf-1.0-install.exe'' to install. Its recommended
that the software be placed in a ``C:\smtpf'' directory for easy 
accessibility to the configuration files, though other locations are
possible if preferred.
	

2. Configuration
----------------

2.1 Unix Systems
----------------

An /etc/smtpf directory should have been created with example
configuration files. Specifically you will need to edit at the very
least /etc/smtpf/route.cf; see section 4 below.

The smtpf binary has a conservative set of built-in defaults for all
the options and can be run without a /etc/smtpf/smtpf.cf file. A
default .cf can be generated with:

	smtpf -help >/etc/smtpf/smtpf.cf
	
This file can then be edited. If you're upgrading between versions,
you can generate a new .cf file that includes your current settings
so that you can compare old and new options. For example:

	smtpf -help file=/etc/smtpf/smtpf.cf >smtpf.new
	diff -u /etc/smtpf/smtpf.cf smtpf.new

The access.cf is similar in style to Sendmail's /etc/mail/access file.
The smtpfmap utility can be used to convert between text format,
Berkeley DB formats, or a socket-map. If the access-map option is set
to ``text!/etc/smtpf/access.cf'', then any time this file is updated
smtpf will have to be restarted. If the Berkeley DB format is used,
``db!/etc/smtpf/access.db'', then smtpf will auto-detect updates and
reopen the file; this is the preferred single machine configuration.

4. Configuration of Mail Transfer Agents
----------------------------------------

smtpf sits in front of one or more mail transfer agents (MTA) on SMTP
port 25. It acts as a proxy, filtering and forwarding mail to one or
more MTAs, which can be on the same machine or different machines.

When the MTA exists on the same machine as smtpf, it will have to be
configured to accept connections on a port other than SMTP port 25,
which smtpf will be listening on. The MTA will also need to be
configured to forward outbound mail via smtpf, if certain features
that need to modify the outbound message headers are to be used.

Assuming smtpf and the local MTA operate on the same machine and that
the MTA is configured to listen on port 26, then in the smtpf route-
map use a ``FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26'' for your LAN and each of your
domains you accept mail for. Example:

	route:::1		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26
	route:127.0.0.1		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26
	route:192.168.0		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26
	route:my.domain		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26
	
In the smtpf route-map, be sure to add a RELAY parameter to your
IPv4 and/or IPv6 local host IP addresses. Example:
	
	route:::1		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26; RELAY
	route:127.0.0.1		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26; RELAY
	
The RELAY tag should be used sparingly, typically only for your
LAN or trusted hosts. It allows mail that is not destined for 
local delivery to be sent outwards to the Internet. Example:

	route:192.168.0		FORWARD: 127.0.0.1:26; RELAY
	route:smtp2.my.domain	RELAY

/WRONG/The route-map RELAY parameter does white list; see access-map.


4.1 Sendmail
------------

To enable sendmail and smtpf to operate on the same machine, edit
the /etc/mail/sendmail.mc file and comment out all existing 
DAEMON_OPTIONS macros. Add the following macro:

	DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Addr=127.0.0.1, Port=26, Name=MTA')

This will allow smtpf to accept, filter, and forward mail for local
delivery via the local MTA.

5. Operating smtpf
------------------


5.1 Unix Systems
----------------

   *	Option and command summary:

		smtpf -help


   *	Start smtpf as a Unix daemon:

		smtpf
	

   *	Start with an alternate configuration file:	

		smtpf file=/path/to/alt-smtpf.cf
		

   *	Start with the built-in configuration:
   
   		smtpf file=""

   		
   *	Changes to the .cf files require the smtpf process to be
   	restarted:

		smtpf -restart
	

   *	To stop smtpf:

		smtpf -quit
	or
		pkill smtpf


5.2 Debugging
-------------

5.2.1 Linux 2.6
---------------

To get core dumps of daemon running process:

	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/suid_dumpable

And prior to starting smtpf:
	
	ulimit -c unlimited 2>&1 > /dev/null


5.2.2 OpenBSD
-------------

To get core dumps of daemon running process:

	sysctl kern.nosuidcoredump=0
