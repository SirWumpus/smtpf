</div>
<div id="chm_content">
&nbsp;

<p>The exit code of 'fpscan' and 'fpscand' is a one byte decimal
(0-255) where each bit corresponds to a certain event that can happen
during scanning.</p>

<p>Bits 1-2 (1 and 2 in decimal) give information about infections that
were found and not disinfected, bits 3-6 (4, 6, 16, 32 in
decimal) give information about various errors and limits that occurred
and bits 7-8 (64 and 128 in decimal) tell whether something
could not be scanned or was disinfected.</p>

<p>The exact meaning of the exitcode depends on the combination of
bits as well as certain combinations of bits also have special
meaning besides their "normal" meaning (see the Exitcodes table at the bottom for full list).</p>
