Avast Daemon Interface
======================

The following is a description of the avast! socket daemon interface. The
interface is identical in both Windows and Linux versions of avast. It uses a
text-based protocol where individual responses are prefixed by a number
(return code), optionally followed by a white space and extra info. Each
line is terminated by the CRLF pair.

By default, the daemon is listening on TCP port 5037.

List of supported commands:
	SCAN
	VPS
	VER
	QUIT

After connecting, the daemon sends the following welcome message:

220 Welcome to avast! Virus scanning daemon x.x (VPS yy-yy dd.mm.yyyy)

and is ready to work. If it is not ready to work, it returns

421 Service not available

and closes the connection to the client.


SCAN
====
The SCAN command is used to scan a file for viruses.

Syntax:

SCAN FileName

Possible return codes:
One of the following:
	501 Syntax error in arguments
	451 Engine error %d
	200 OK

If the return value is 200 OK, there will follow one or more (in the case of
archives) lines with scan status, each in the following format: 

Filepath\t[Status]\tMoreInfo

where:
	\t is ASCII character 9 (tab)
	FilePath is full path to the scanned file
	[Status] is one of the following values
	[+] - scan succeeded, the file is clean
	[L] - scan succeeded, the file is infected, for more info see
MoreInfo
	[E] - scan failed, for more info see MoreInfo
	MoreInfo has the following meaning
	In case [Status] = [L], contains the name of the virus
	In case [Status] = [E], contains the error code and the error
descriptions
	(In case [Status] = [+], doesn't contain any information)

Following these lines there is a blank line which signals the end of data
transter from the daemon side.

Note
The return code (at the beginning of the first line) does not say anything
about the infection status of the file! To find out the virus status, it is
necessary to parse the result lines that follow the first line - provided
the return code was 200. 

VPS
===
The VPS command is used to find out the current version of the virus
database (aka VPS file)

Syntax:

VPS

Possible return codes:
One of the following:
	501 Syntax error in arguments
	200 OK

If it is 200 OK, another line will follow, with the format: 

VerMajor-VerMinor MM.DD.YYYY

VerMajor and VerMinor make us the VPS version tag, MM.DD.YYYY is its release
time stamp.


VER
===
The VER command is used to find out the current version of the scanning
engine.
 
Syntax:

VER

Possible return codes:
One of the following:
	501 Syntax error in arguments
	200 OK

If it is 200 OK, another line will follow, with the format: 

VerMajor.VerMinor


QUIT
====
The QUIT is used to terminate the session. After the command is sent, the
daemon will automatically close the connection.

Syntax:

QUIT

Possible return codes:
Just one:

221 Service closing transmission channel

(eventual arguments of this command are ignored).


Notes
-----
Any other command returns the following response:

500 Syntax error, command unrecognized
